The purpose of the ECE Calculator is to provide a useful tool for analyzing circuits. It will consist of a standard calculator with options to convert between common units and prefixes used in ECE. The calculator will be able to evaluate boolean expressions. Also available will be common formulas used in ECE, such as Ohm's Law, Equivalent Series/Parallel combination, Capacitors and Inductors, etc.
